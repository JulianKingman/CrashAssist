                "<p>This force of whiplash can result in muscle strains and tears, vertebrae being shoved out of their normal position and the spinal cord being stretched and irritated. The brain may even be injured by hitting the inside of your skull.</p>" +
                "<p>Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, a standard x-ray cannot detect whiplash, so it is much harder to diagnose and easier to go untreated. Stress and or motion x- rays are the best ways to document these soft tissue injuries, so it is essential that if you’ve been in an accident you seek treatment with someone who can provide these diagnostic tests.</p>"
